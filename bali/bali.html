        <p class="bigtext">Balangan Beach is one of Bali's most popular vacation destinations. While on the beach, you have a perfect view of the beautiful limestone cliffs while soaking up some sun in the golden sand. To make things even better, it's just a two minute walk from the flowerbud bungalows!</p>

                    <br/>ancient historic site and a well known place of
                    <br/>worship.</figcaption>
    </figure>
        
        <p class="bigtext">The Dharma Durga Kutri Temple is a sacred and religious  site. Upon entering the lower level of the temple, your're faced with several pavillions as well as a beautiful array of statues dating back centuries ago! There's even a stone stairway leading you through the lush greenery of a Bayan tree forest.</p>

    </figure>
        
        <p class="bigtext">The Gitgit Waterfall is not only one of Bali's most picturesque falls, but also a popular place to take in the sensational sounds of the water pounding on the rocks. Take a dip in the refreshing thirty-five meter high waterfall but beware the myth; Local legend has it that couples who bathe together under the waterfall will not stay together!</p>
